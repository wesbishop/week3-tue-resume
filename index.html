        <p>I considered astronomy - but apparently my credentials were lacking. I was dumbfounded by the lack of response.</p>
        <p>My top 3 influencers were...</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Morgan Freeman for Presdident</h3>
            <p class="p-reasons">Episodes of 'Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman' occupy 50% of the total recording space on our DVR. My wife thinks quantum mechanics and string theory is pretty useless but I catch her every so often peeking to see what E.T looks like.
              I make claim to having watched several hundred hours of this series and have growing confidence in my ability to accurately describe cause and effect for quasars - well...kind of sort of...ok maybe not.

            <h3>Hubble pictures are the coolest</h3>
            <p class="p-reasons">Hubble gave the world of non-astronomers a reason to like astronomy. We can dismiss the strange and peculiar mathematics for pretty pictures of nebulas, spiral galaxies, red dwarfs and other cool tuff a billion light years away. While hubble
              redefined our perspective of 'In a galaxy far,far away', it's successor <a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">JWST</a> might actually peer deep enough to see the moons on Tatooine! I'm terribly saddened about the delayed launch date:</p>

            <blockquote cite="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-james-webb-space-telescope-to-be-launched-spring-2019">“The change in launch timing is not indicative of hardware or technical performance concerns,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate at Headquarters in Washington. “Rather, the integration of
              the various spacecraft elements is taking longer than expected.”
